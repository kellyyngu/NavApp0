Setup the environment first in the directory by running the following:
    python -m venv flask_yolo_env
    flask_yolo_env\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application with python web-app.py

NOTE:
The requirements.txt file may fail based on your device compatibility. You can still run the program by installing the required libraries separately.

There are some sample images in the test-images folder to test the app with.
